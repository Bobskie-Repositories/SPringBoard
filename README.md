# SPringBoard

Naming of branch: <br />

Major update = ascend/ * name of big update *

Fix = fix/ * name of fix *

Init = init/ * name of initialize * (e.g init/dependencies) 
<br />
<br />

Kindly see the "Folder Organization" file for notes/documentation on how to organize your files. <br />

Reuse the styles and components
<br />

Note: I used the "npm create vite@latest" for creating the project. You still have to enter "npm install" and "npm run dev"
