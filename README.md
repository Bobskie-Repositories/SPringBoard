# SPringBoard

Naming of branch: <br />
* LASTNAME/frontend
* LASTNAME/backend
<br />
<br />

Kindly see the "Folder Organization" file for notes/documentation on how to organize your files. <br />

Reuse the styles and components
<br />

Note: I used the "npm create vite@latest" for creating the project. You still have to enter "npm install" and "npm run dev"

Note: For backend, download and install python. Install xampp
In terminal,
pip install django
pip install django djangorestframework
pip install mysqlclient
